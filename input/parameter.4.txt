// In this example a perfect HCC crystal is created. The
// keyword is CREATEHCP, the baseunit is the number of 
// points per direction. In the FCC case this means that
// there are N = baseunit**3 points in the system.
// xBox, yBox and zBox are the dimensions of the Box.
// A HCP strucuture does not fit into a qubic box, 
// the shape of the box is:
// x = a
// y = a * sqrt(3)/2
// z = a * sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)

XYZFile=CREATEHCP
BaseUnit=8
xBox=10.0000000

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance
