// Example of a parameter file to read a xyz file 
// and output the orderparameters. The filename is
// given to XYZFile as a relative path to the 
// path where the program is executed. 
// The xyz file should start with the number of Points 
// in the system, followed by three lines containing the
// dimensions of the Box in x,y, and z directions.
// Then N lines with the positions of the points. 

XYZFile=./input/configuration.dat

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance

NeighborDistance=5
