// In this example a perfect FCC crystal is created. The
// keyword is CREATEFCC, the baseunit is the number of 
// points per direction. In the FCC case this means that
// there are N = 4*baseunit**3 points in the system.
// xBox, yBox and zBox are the dimensionso of the Box.

BaseUnit=4
xBox=20.0
yBox=20.0

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance
