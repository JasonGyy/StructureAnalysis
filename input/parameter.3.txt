// In this example a perfect BCC crystal is created. The
// keyword is CREATEBCC, the baseunit is the number of 
// points per direction. In the BCC case this means that
// there are N = 2*baseunit**3 points in the system.
// xBox, yBox and zBox are the dimensions of the Box.

XYZFile=CREATEBCC
BaseUnit=4
xBox=20.0
yBox=20.0
zBox=20.0

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance
