 NOTES ON THE INSTALLATION:
 
 Generate the executable with 
 
 make
 
 This will create a executable "main" in the base directory. There are 4 examples 
 inclued that show the basic use of the package. When executing
 
 ./main 1
 
 the parameter file "parameter.1.txt" in the input directory will be used. This 
 demonstrates an example where a configuration is read and analysed. The configuration
 that is read is "configuration.dat". For further information have a look at the
 comments in the parameter file.
 

 ./main 2 
 ./main 3
 ./main 4

 demonstrates how to create a prefect FCC,BCC or HCP crystal, respectively. For further
 information see the comments in the respective parameterfiles.
